* Spn
Spn is a small amateur game development library written on top of SDL.

I would be very surprised if anyone apart from me ends up using this, it's mainly just a bit of fun

* Dependencies
  - a C++ compiler, e.g. gcc
  - make
  - CMake
  - SDL
  - SDL_image

* Examples
There are examples of how to use the library in spn/examples. They all do something a little different, and are usually a little over the top to demonstrate a feature thoroughly

* Unit tests
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
mkdir -p build/tests
cd build/tests
cmake ../../spn/tests
make
./tests
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is just a recommendation and the method i use to keep my source directory nice and clean. In source building should work just fine but is rarely tested!
