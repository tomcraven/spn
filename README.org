* Spn
Spn is a small amateur game development library written on top of SDL.

I would be very surprised if anyone apart from me ends up using this, it's mainly just a bit of fun

* Dependencies
** make
** CMake
** SDL
** SDL_image

* Examples
There are examples of how to use the library in spn/examples. They all do something a little different, and are usually a little over the top to demonstrate a feature thoroughly

* Building
Try to build out of source, your directory structure should look something like this:

```
- spn
- spn-sdl
- my-awesome-game
- build
  - my-awesome-game-build
```

e.g. if you are building one of the example games:

```
mkdir -p build/balls
cd build/balls
cmake ../../spn/examples/balls
make
ln -s ../../spn/examples/balls/assets/textures textures
ln -s ../../spn/examples/balls/assets/fonts fonts
./balls
```

However, this is just a recommendation and the method i use to keep my source directory nice and clean. In source building should work just fine but is rarely tested!
